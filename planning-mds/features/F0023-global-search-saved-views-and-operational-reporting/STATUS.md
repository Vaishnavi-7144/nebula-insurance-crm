## Required Signoff Roles (Set in Planning)

> Phase B Architect-confirmed matrix. Feature closeout evidence is collected later by `agents/actions/feature.md`.

| Role | Required | Why Required | Set By | Date |
|------|----------|--------------|--------|------|
| Quality Engineer | Yes | Search accuracy, saved-view persistence, projection freshness, and reporting correctness require independent test evidence. | Architect | 2026-06-19 |
| Code Reviewer | Yes | Cross-object query behavior, authorization filtering, saved-view mutations, projections, and report drilldowns require independent review. | Architect | 2026-06-19 |
| Security Reviewer | Yes | Search/reporting crosses visibility boundaries; counts, snippets, suggestions, saved-view metadata, and reports must not leak unauthorized records. | Architect | 2026-06-19 |
| DevOps | Yes | Projection backfill/refresh behavior and runtime lag/failure metrics require deployability and operations evidence. | Architect | 2026-06-19 |
| Architect | Yes | Cross-cutting search/reporting architecture and ontology bindings require G0 assembly-plan validation. | Architect | 2026-06-19 |

## Planning Decisions

- F0023 is internal-only for CRM Release MVP.
- Core search/saved-view/reporting substrate can build in parallel with F0017.
- Hierarchy/territory facets depend on F0017 data.
- Hierarchy-aware access-control enforcement and distribution rollups remain deferred to F0037.
- Full document-content search, report scheduling, and free-form report builder are out of scope.
- Phase B selected a PostgreSQL read-side SearchReporting module; no external search engine is added for MVP.
- Saved-view team scope is represented as `teamScopeType` + `teamScopeKey` and validated against the current authorization context.
- Saved-view mutations are audited through `SavedViewAuditEvent`.
